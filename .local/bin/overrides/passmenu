# This script exists because I want to use dmenu instead of dmenu-wl, which passmenu
# defaults to if it sees that your $WAYLAND_DISPLAY variable is set.  I also passed
# $PINENTRY_USER_DATA which will eventually reach the pinentry-wrapper script and launch
# a graphical pinentry as opposed to my curses default, since launching pinentry-curses
# outside of a terminal just breaks everything.
